# TodoMVC PhoneGap Exercise

## Overview

In this exercise, we are going to use [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) to make our Todo App into a native app for iOS and Android.

The whole exercise is going to walk you through creating iOS app and Android app. If you get into a problem and can't figure out how to get a specific step done, feel free to read the [reference code](https://github.com/CatChen/todomvc/tree/courses/todo-course) on Github.

### Step 1: iOS App

In order to build an iOS app, we need to get the latest version of [Xcode](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id448457090?mt=12), which includes the iOS Simulator.

After installing Xcode, we can follow the [tutorial from PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/start#ios-x4) to build an iOS app and run it in iOS Simulator.

### Step 2: Android App

[Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) and [Eclipse Classic](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) are needed for building an Android app. After downloaded these two, follow the [Android SDK installation document](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) to install Android SDK.

After installing Android SDK and Eclipse, we can follow the [tutorial from PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/start#android) to build an Android app and run it in an Android device or virtual device.
